# performance-calculator
Super simple CLI to use [MaxOhn](https://github.com/MaxOhn)'s [rosu-pp](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp) to calculate full-combo NM performance points for exactly 95%, 98%, 100%. Designed to be used with [BanchoMultiplayerBot](https://github.com/matte-ek/BanchoMultiplayerBot), and is probably not suited for anything else.

## Usage

Applcation already expects map files to be located at `cache/<map-id>.osu`

```
> performance-calculator.exe <map id>
<pp for 100%>
<pp for 98%>
<pp for 95%>
